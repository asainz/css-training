# Specificity on selectors.

Specificity is a mechanism within the CSS cascade that aids conflict resolution. The concept of specificity states that 
when two or more declarations that apply to the same element, and set the same property, have the same importance and 
origin, the declaration with the most specific selector will take precedence.

## How is calculated?

Here’s a simplified description of the process by which the specificity of the selectors of two or more declarations is compared:

1. If one declaration is from a style attribute, rather than a rule with a selector (an inline style), it has the highest 
specificity. If none of the declarations are inline, proceed to step two.

2. Count the ID selectors. The declaration with the highest count has the highest specificity. If two or more have the same 
number of ID selectors, or they all have zero ID selectors, proceed to step three.

3. Count the class selectors (for example, .test), attribute selectors (for example, [type="submit"]), and pseudo-classes (for 
example, :hover). The declaration with the highest total has the highest specificity. If two or more have the same total, or 
they all have totals of zero, proceed to step four.

4. Count the element type selectors (for example div) and pseudo-elements (for example, :first-letter). The declaration with 
the highest total has the highest specificity.

Note: The universal selector, ```*```, and the child combinator, ```>``` don’t have any specificity at all; they’re simply 
ignored in all calculations. This is true for all combinators, which you can treat as though they had a specificity of zero, 
as they will make no difference to your calculation. 

### List the values for each selector.

Let’s try and break down each part of the calculation procedure so that it’s more understandable. 

| A			 				| B 		| C 																			| D 																|
| ------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Inline Style	| IDs		| Classes, Attributes, and Pseudo-classes	| Element Types and Pseudo-elements |

***First step:*** Calculate the value for **Inline Style**. If the style rule is specified within the 
element’s HTML style attribute, column **A** should equal 1; otherwise, it should equal 0. In fact, this 
is the only case where there is a value in column **A**.

Here’s an example of such a style rule:

```html
<p style="color:red;">Red Text</p>
```

| Inline Style | IDs | Classes, Attributes, and Pseudo-classes | Element Types and Pseudo-elements |
| ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1						 | 0	 | 0 																			 | 0 																 |

As you can see, an inline style rule will always have a specificity of 1,0,0,0—the highest level of specificity.

For rules other than inline styles, we need to calculate columns **B**, **C**, and **D**. Let’s run through a full calculation 
for the following rule:

```css
body#home div#warning p.message {
  color: red;
}
```

Since this isn’t an inline style, we start off with a 0 in the first column:

| Inline Style | IDs | Classes, Attributes, and Pseudo-classes | Element Types and Pseudo-elements |
| ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0						 | ?	 | ? 																			 | ? 																 |

***Second step:*** Calculate the value for column **B**, we count the number of ID selectors in the selector. In our selector, 
```body#home div#warning p.message```, there are ```#home``` and ```#warning```, column **B** is equal to 2.

| Inline Style | IDs | Classes, Attributes, and Pseudo-classes | Element Types and Pseudo-elements |
| ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0						 | 2	 | ? 																			 | ? 																 |

***Third step:*** Calculate the value for column **C**, counting the number of class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes 
in the selector. There’s one class selector, ```.message```, so, column **C** is equal to 1.

| Inline Style | IDs | Classes, Attributes, and Pseudo-classes | Element Types and Pseudo-elements |
| ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0						 | 2	 | 1 																			 | ? 																 |

*Attribute Selectors for IDs:* Note that ```[id="foo"]``` is not equivalent to ```#foo```. There’s a significant difference in their 
levels of specificity.

***Fourth step:*** For column **D**, we count the number of element type selectors and pseudo-elements in the selector. In our example 
selector, ```body#home div#warning p.message```, there are three: ```body```, ```div```, and ```p```. There are no 
pseudo-elements to be counted, so we put a 3 in the last column.

| Inline Style | IDs | Classes, Attributes, and Pseudo-classes | Element Types and Pseudo-elements |
| ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0						 | 2	 | 1 																			 | 3 																 |

We now have our result. The specificity for the selector ```body#home div#warning p.message``` can be expressed as: **0,2,1,3**.


## What is ```!important```?

When an ```!important``` rule is used on a style declaration, this declaration overrides any other declaration made in the CSS, 
wherever it is in the declaration list. Although, ```!important``` has nothing to do with specificity.

### Why is usually not recommended?

Using ```!important``` is bad practice and should be avoided because it makes debugging more difficult by breaking the natural 
cascading in your stylesheets. When two conflicting declarations with the ```!important``` rule are applied to the same element, the 
declaration with greater specificity will be applied.

### How to override ```!important```

1. Simply add another CSS rule with ```!important```, and either give the selector a higher specificity (adding an additional tag, id 
or class to the selector), or add a CSS rule with the same selector at a later point than the existing one (in a tie, the last 
one defined wins).

```css
table td    {height: 50px !important;} /* 0002 */
.myTable td {height: 50px !important;} /* 0102 */
#myTable td {height: 50px !important;} /* 0110 */
```

2. Add the same selector after the existing one.

3. Rewrite the original rule to avoid the use of ```!important``` altogether.


## What happens if two selectors have the same specificity? Which one is applied?

If two or more selectors have the same specificity, then, according to the rules of the CSS cascade, the latter specified 
rule takes precedence.


## Example:

Let’s consider a crazy situation where more than half a dozen color declarations for the same ```p``` element have the same 
levels of importance and origins. Which color would the browser apply to the element?

```css
p.message {
  color: green;
}
#home #warning p.message {
  color: yellow;
}
#warning p.message {
  color: white;
}
body#home div#warning p.message {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: teal;
}
* body#home>div#warning p.message {
  color: red;
}
#warning p {
  color: black;
}
```

| Selector                                | Inline Style | IDs | Classes, Attributes, and Pseudo-classes | Element Types and Pseudo-elements |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ```body#home div#warning p.message```   | 0            | 2   | 1                                       | 3                                 |
| ```* body#home>div#warning p.message``` | 0            | 2   | 1                                       | 3                                 |
| ```#home #warning p.message```          | 0            | 2   | 1                                       | 1                                 |
| ```#warning p.message```                | 0            | 1   | 1                                       | 1                                 |
| ```#warning p```                        | 0            | 1   | 0                                       | 1                                 |
| ```p.message```                         | 0            | 0   | 1                                       | 1                                 |
| ```p```                                 | 0            | 0   | 0                                       | 1                                 |

The results have been ordered according to specificity—the highest are at the top, and the lowest are at the bottom. As you 
can see, the top two selectors have exactly the same specificity, despite the extra universal selector and combinator in one 
of them. In this case, they tie for specificity and the one that appears last in the style sheet will be the winner. If you 
look at the original style sheet source above, the red color will be applied to the ```p``` element.

You can see from table that the selector ```p.message``` has a lower specificity than the selector ```#warning p```. This is 
a common cause of head scratching among those new to CSS, who often think that a class selector will be specific enough to 
match an element in all cases.

Finally, let take a look at how the browser read this and the final style is applied with an image from firebug.
